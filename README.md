# Serve a lightweight HR assistant

![chat-example.png](docs/images/chat-example.png)

Replace hours spent searching policy documents with higher-value relational work. 

## Detailed description 

The *Assistant to the HR Representative* is a lightweight quickstart designed to
give HR Representatives in Financial Services a trusted sounding board for discussions and decisions. 
Chat with this assistant for quick insights and actionable advice. 

This quickstart was designed for environments where GPUs are not available or
necessary, making it ideal for lightweight inference use cases, prototyping, or
constrained environments. By making the most of vLLM on CPU-based
infrastructure, this Assistant to the HR Representative can be deployed to almost any OpenShift AI
environment. 

This quickstart includes a Helm chart for deploying:

- An OpenShift AI Project.
- vLLM with CPU support running an instance of TinyLlama.
- AnythingLLM, a versatile chat interface, running as a workbench and connected
  to the vLLM.
  
Use this project to quickly spin up a minimal vLLM instance and start serving
models like TinyLlama on CPU—no GPU required. 🚀

Here's an example machine from AWS that works well: [https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/m6i.4xlarge](https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/m6i.4xlarge)

### Minimum software requirements

- Red Hat OpenShift 4.16.24 or later
- Red Hat OpenShift AI 2.16.2 or later
- Dependencies for [Single-model server](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.16/html/installing_and_uninstalling_openshift_ai_self-managed/installing-the-single-model-serving-platform_component-install#configuring-automated-installation-of-kserve_component-install):
    - Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh
    - Red Hat OpenShift Serverless

### Required user permissions

- Standard user. No elevated cluster permissions required.


## Deploy

Follow the below steps to deploy and test the HR assistant.

### Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/llm-cpu-serving.git && \
    cd llm-cpu-serving/  
```

<!-- ### (Optional) Update storage class name

If needed, update storage class name in `helm/values.yaml`.
```
storageClassName: gp3-csi
``` -->

### Create the project

```bash
PROJECT="hr-assistant"

oc new-project ${PROJECT}
``` 

### Install with Helm

```bash
helm install ${PROJECT} helm/ --namespace ${PROJECT} 
```

### (Alternative) Install with GitOps (ArgoCD)

If you want the application to be managed via GitOps from the start, use the bootstrap script:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-gitops.sh
```

Alternatively, you can manually enable GitOps during Helm installation:
1. Update `gitops.repoURL` in `helm/values.yaml` to point to your fork.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   helm install ${PROJECT} helm/ --namespace ${PROJECT} --set gitops.enabled=true
   ```

### Wait for pods

```
oc -n ${PROJECT}  get pods -w
```

```
(Output)
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
anythingllm-0                                 3/3     Running     0          76s
anythingllm-seed-lchf6                        0/1     Completed   0          76s
tinyllama-1b-cpu-predictor-544bdf75f9-x9fwh   2/2     Running     0          75s
```

### Test

You can get the OpenShift AI Dashboard URL by:
```bash
oc get routes rhods-dashboard -n redhat-ods-applications
```

Once inside the dashboard, navigate to Data Science Projects -> tinyllama-cpu-demo (or what you called your ${PROJECT} if you changed from default).

Inside the project you can see Workbenches, open up the one for AnythingLLM.

Finally, click on the **Assistant to the HR Representative** Workspace that's pre-created for you and you can start chatting with your Assistant to the HR Representative! :)  
Try for example asking it:
```
Hi, one of our employees is going to get a raise, what do I need to keep in mind for this?
```
It will provide you a reply and some citations related to the question.
